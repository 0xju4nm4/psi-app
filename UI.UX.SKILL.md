# iOS React UI/UX Design Skill

A comprehensive skill for building React applications (web and React Native) with authentic iOS design patterns, glassmorphism effects, and premium user experiences.

## What This Skill Does

This skill helps you create:
- **iOS-native UI components** following Apple's Human Interface Guidelines
- **Glassmorphism & Liquid Glass effects** with proper blur, transparency, and layering
- **iOS animations** using spring physics and proper timing
- **Accessible interfaces** with VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, and Reduce Motion support
- **Dark mode support** with iOS system colors
- **Responsive layouts** for all iOS device sizes
- **Performance-optimized** components with native driver animations

## When to Use This Skill

Trigger this skill when you want to:
- Build DeFi/fintech apps with premium iOS aesthetics
- Implement glassmorphism or frosted glass effects
- Create iOS-native navigation patterns
- Add smooth iOS-style animations
- Ensure accessibility compliance
- Support iOS Safe Area and device variations
- Follow Apple's design system

## Quick Start

### Example Prompts

**Basic Component:**
```
Create an iOS-style card component with glassmorphism for displaying crypto balance
```

**Navigation:**
```
Build a bottom sheet modal that slides up with iOS spring animation
```

**Forms:**
```
Design an input form with iOS-native styling and validation states
```

**Advanced Effects:**
```
Create a navigation header with blur that scrolls with content underneath
```

## Key Features Covered

### 1. Glassmorphism Effects
- Backdrop blur implementation
- Proper transparency levels (0.1-0.25)
- Text contrast overlays
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility (Reduce Transparency)
- iOS 26 Liquid Glass support

### 2. iOS Design Patterns
- Bottom tab navigation
- Modal presentations
- Grouped lists (Settings-style)
- Card layouts
- Form inputs
- Pull-to-refresh

### 3. iOS Animations
- Spring physics (friction: 7-8, tension: 40)
- Micro-interactions
- Gesture-driven animations
- Native driver optimization
- Reduce Motion support

### 4. iOS Color System
- System colors (blue, red, green, etc.)
- Light/dark mode variants
- Label hierarchies
- Fill colors
- Background colors
- Proper separators

### 5. Typography
- iOS text styles (Large Title to Caption)
- SF Pro font stack
- Dynamic Type support
- Proper line heights

### 6. Accessibility
- VoiceOver labels and hints
- 44x44pt touch targets
- WCAG color contrast
- Reduce Motion
- Reduce Transparency
- Dynamic Type

## Component Examples

The skill provides complete examples for:
- GlassCard component
- Bottom sheet modal
- iOS button variants
- Form inputs
- Navigation headers
- Tab bars
- Pull-to-refresh
- Micro-interactions

## Libraries Recommended

### React Native
- `@react-native-community/blur` - Glass effects
- `@callstack/liquid-glass` - iOS 26 Liquid Glass
- `react-native-reanimated` - Animations
- `react-native-gesture-handler` - Gestures
- `Tamagui` or `gluestack-ui` - Component libraries

### React Web
- `Framer Motion` - Animations
- `Radix UI` - Headless components
- `Tailwind CSS` - Utility styling

## Evaluation Test Cases

The skill includes 10 evaluation cases covering:
1. Glassmorphic DeFi card
2. Bottom sheet modal
3. Grouped settings list
4. Button with haptic feedback
5. Blur navigation header
6. Form inputs with validation
7. Liquid Glass portfolio card
8. Pull-to-refresh
9. Tab bar navigation
10. Like button micro-interaction

## Code Quality Standards

Every implementation should:
- ✅ Follow iOS Human Interface Guidelines
- ✅ Use iOS system colors and typography
- ✅ Support Safe Area
- ✅ Include light/dark mode
- ✅ Meet accessibility requirements (WCAG AA)
- ✅ Use spring animations with proper physics
- ✅ Optimize performance (native driver, memoization)
- ✅ Support all iOS device sizes

## Best Practices

### Glassmorphism
- Blur: 10-30px
- Background opacity: 0.1-0.25
- Add text contrast overlay
- Limit to 2-3 layers
- Respect Reduce Transparency

### Animations
- Use spring (not linear)
- Friction: 7-8
- Tension: 40
- Duration: 200-400ms
- Always use native driver
- Respect Reduce Motion

### Accessibility
- Touch targets: 44x44pt minimum
- Contrast: 4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for UI
- Proper labels and hints
- Support system preferences

## Testing Checklist

Before finalizing components:
- [ ] iOS HIG compliance
- [ ] Light and dark mode
- [ ] Safe Area handling
- [ ] Accessibility labels
- [ ] Contrast ratios verified
- [ ] Animations smooth (60fps)
- [ ] Touch targets adequate
- [ ] Dynamic Type support
- [ ] VoiceOver tested

## Using the Skill

Simply mention iOS design, glassmorphism, or premium UI in your request:

```
"Make this card look like an iOS widget with glass effect"
"Add iOS-style animations to this button"
"Create a navigation header like iOS Messages app"
"Build this with iOS Human Interface Guidelines"
```

The skill will automatically apply iOS design patterns, proper colors, typography, animations, and accessibility features.
